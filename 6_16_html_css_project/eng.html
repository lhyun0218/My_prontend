            <p class="name"><b>What is programming?</b></p>
            <p>Just as the language that humans understand is called ‘language,’ the language that computers understand is called ‘programming language.’
A programming language is a tool for creating software (games, programs, PowerPoint, etc.) that runs on a computer.
A person who creates software using a programming language is called a programmer, and writing programs is called coding.
</p>
            <p class="two_name"><b><br>Wait ! Programming and coding?</b></p>
            <p>Both refer to the same task. Programming is an expression closer to a computer because it means expressing it with computer instructions, and coding is an expression closer to a language because it means writing code in a programming language such as Python.</p><br>

            <p class="name"><b>Ranking of programming languages!</b></p>
            <p>TIOBE also discloses the popularity of each programming language every month. <br> Below are the top 20 programming languages ​​as of March 2024, as selected by TIOBE. <br>
I think these results will help you in choosing a programming language. From 1st to 5th place are Python, C, C++, Java, and C#.</p>

            <p>People who first start coding often worry about which language to learn. In fact, it is better to be clear about what you want to create rather than using words..</p>

            <p class="name"><b>Recommended learning sequence</b></p>
            <p>Since there are many different types of programming languages, you may wonder, 'Which language should I study first?' You will worry about this.
If you search here and there, you will find 'Study Python first.', 'Study C language first.' And so on, you will hear various stories.
There is no set order. Before choosing a programming language, it is important to first decide on the purpose for which you will study.
If there is software you want to create, you can start with a language specific to that platform.</p>
            <p><b>If you are a major, I recommend learning the C language first.</b></p>
            <p><mark>&lt; C language - Java - Python - Language required for target field  &gt;</mark></p>
            <p>The C language can be considered the foundation of all programming languages. Other languages ​​were created based on the C language,
so it is very helpful when studying other languages. Additionally, the compilation engine that interprets the language is often composed of the C language.
However, the level of difficulty is high. It operates in a similar way to hardware, so it has the fastest execution speed. It's great for learning the basic concepts and principles of programming.</p>
            <p><b>If you are a non-major, I recommend starting programming with Python.</b></p>
            <p><mark>&lt;Python - C language - Java - Language required for target field&gt;</mark></p>
            <p>Compared to other languages, Python has a simpler syntax, making it less difficult.
Because Python is a programming language with a low barrier to entry, it is an easy language to learn for beginners as well as non-majors in programming.
</p>
            <p><b>If you have to learn just one programming language, I recommend Java.</b></p>
